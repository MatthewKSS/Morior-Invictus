Adventure, Tech, Magic and more!  This pack is a complex and difficult pack that will lead you through each mod via quests and achievements.  Everything was built by hand and configs modified to make the experience smooth and playable.  The pack is based around Create, and then branches out to each mod through a specific set of items.  The progression is difficult but you will find it fun and engaging.  Please check out our GitHub to ask questions and see what changed from version to version!\
