\
This is the location of the tickets for the Morior-Invictus pack that was created by my friends and I.  
If you have any issues, let us know here.\
\
This pack is intended to to be an amalgamation of many different mods meant to give a challenge and linear progression while allowing you to explore many different mods.\
\
Release 1.1 has been added under Morrior Invictus01.0.Zip.\
Instructions: Download this file and import it into Curseforge.  The pack is also available through Curseforge via this link: https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/morrior-invictus\
\
\
This pack is being updated on a regular schedule.  Release 1.1 is out!  Download to check it out.  It's available here, and on our GitHub Page.\
\
\
\
Adventure, Tech, Magic and more!  This pack is a complex and difficult pack that will lead you through each mod via quests and achievements.  Everything was built by hand and configs modified to make the experience smooth and playable.  The pack is based around Create, and then branches out to each mod through a specific set of items.  The progression is difficult but you will find it fun and engaging.  Please check out our GitHub to ask questions and see what changed from version to version!\
